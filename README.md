<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />


<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- Intake
- Assignment and Communication
- Working the Issue
- Resolution

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
If you click on this link http://localhost/osTicket/ you will be directed to the page where end users submit a ticket. As seen, there's a tab in the picture which has the page open for help desk staff to login & handle tickets (obviously it wouldn't be this way, but the takeaway is that end users have their own site to submit tickets).

As you can see Robert is creating a ticket, the help topic is "Business Critical Outage" because customers are reporting that they cannot access mobile banking.

Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. In some ticketing system customers can set their own SLA plans.
